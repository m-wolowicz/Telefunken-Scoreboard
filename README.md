# Telefunken-Scoreboard

This is a simple score pad and scoreboard for the card game Telefunken.


## Overview

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, Jquery, Firebase Database and maybe an API, I will create a simple single scorepad to be used while playing the Telefunken card game. Once each game is finished, all scores will be saved, along with informaiton on the game (like the date), inside an entry on the Firebase database.


#### Setup

Using a jumbotron, Ojeda family crest logo, tables and columns, information will be displayed on the first page to open a new page and begin scoring your game. After the game is over, the data of the game will be stored in another page where all the game history is.

#### Instructions

Still in development.
